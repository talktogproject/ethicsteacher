## What is Research Integrity?

Being an ethical researcher is not only about:
* Submitting an ethics form
* Making participants sign a consent form

It is about conducting research that is scientifically rigorous and trustworthy, as captured by the quote below<sup>[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25009901/)</sup>:

> The scientific enterprise is built on a foundation of trust. Society trusts that scientific research results are an honest and accurate reflection of a researcher’s work. Researchers equally trust that their colleagues have gathered data carefully, have used appropriate analytic and statistical techniques, have reported their results accurately, and have treated the work of other researchers with respect.

Researchers should then<sup>[2](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/researchsupport/documents/media/research_integrityv6_web.pdf)</sup>:

* be aware of existing laws, codes of practice, policies, and publication rules in their field
* gain the necessary skills and training (including ethics training) applicable to their field
* take the initiative in asking questions or raising concerns when issues arise
* be transparent and accountable to their peers and their organization

The responsibility to uphold research integrity rests not only on the individual researcher, but also on their colleagues, collaborators, universities and organizations, funding agencies, and the wider scientific community.

### Something to think about:

Does your team, organization, academic field, and/or funder have clear policies and systems for:
* Getting ethics approval
* Training researchers in research ethics and study protocols
* Reporting changes in research protocols
* Reporting research misconduct
* Monitoring and evaluating progress in your research project

Did you say 'yes' to all of the above? Do you know who is responsible for each of the points above? If not, then it is good to look for more information within your team, organization, or research field.
