# Scenario Discussion and Q&A

## Instructions

### 1. Download and study [the 4 scenarios](https://github.com/talktogproject/ethics/raw/gh-pages/casevignettes.pdf) ahead of the live discussion. 

Try to answer these 3 questions using concepts and principles you learned in the online course:
* Problem Assessment: What went wrong in this situation?
* Risk Assessment: Was anybody or anything put at risk in this situation? What/who are they and why?
* Solutions: What solutions can be offered or how do we avoid this kind of situation?

The case vignettes are all fictional situations and are meant for training and discussion purposes.

For real case studies, the [British Educational Research Association](https://www.bera.ac.uk/publication-series/research-ethics-case-studies) has several published on their website.

### 2. On the scheduled date and time, join the online discussion using the meeting invitation sent to you via e-mail.

### 3. Please submit any feedback or questions about the online course [through Qualtrics](https://oxfordeducation.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aadm75VACamhF9Y) (_password required_)
