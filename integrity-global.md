## International Collaborations and Ethics Dumping

International research collaborations, on the one hand, can lead to a meaningful exchange of knowledge and skills between partners. On the other hand, partnerships between institutions in the so-called Global North and the Global South can also be unequal, or worse, exploitative.

_Ethics dumping_ refers to the exporting of unethical ethics practices to low- and middle-income countries<sup>[1](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-64731-9_1)</sup>.

> Ethics dumping occurs mainly in two areas. First, when research participants and/or resources in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are exploited intentionally, for instance because research can be undertaken in an LMIC that would be prohibited in a high-income country. Second, exploitation can occur due to insufficient ethics awareness on the part of the researcher, or low research governance capacity in the host nation. (p. 2)

Many famous examples come from health and biological research<sup>[2](https://theconversation.com/ethics-dumping-the-dark-side-of-international-research-88675)</sup>; however, The Guardian provides some examples that are also relevant to education and social sciences research<sup>[3](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/aug/31/ethics-dumping-the-exploitative-side-of-academic-research)</sup>, such as:

* Avoiding local ethics approval
* Lack of awareness about the community, e.g., not contacting community leaders before conducting a study
* Insensitive behaviour, e.g., entering indigenous people's homes and taking pictures without consent
* 'Extractive' research, e.g., not sharing benefits of the study or knowledge gained with the community being studied

The Global Code of Conduct<sup>[4](https://www.globalcodeofconduct.org/)</sup> was established to fight against ethics dumping and to promote equal partnerships between high-income and low- and middle-income countries around the world. The code of conduct has 4 main principles; namely:

### **1. Fairness**
  - Collaborating with local communities on issues that are relevant to them
  - Involving researchers throughout the entire research process wherever possible, including in the sharing of data, intellectual property, and authorship of publications
  - Fair compensation for local staff and contributors, e.g., translators, interpreters, and local coordinators
  
### **2. Respect**
  - Being sensitive to local cultural settings and practices
  - Getting local community agreement and working with existing community structures
  - Seeking approval from local research ethics committees and taking advice from these committees, even when ethics approval from a high-income setting has already been received
  
### **3. Care**
  - Procedures for getting consent and raising questions and complaints must be accessible, easy to understand, and agreed upon with the local communities
  - No double standard: If research would be restricted or prohibited in a high-income country, then this should not be done in a low- and middle-income country either
  - Potential risks to the participants (e.g., discrimination due to sensitive information shared) and researchers (e.g., security), or potential burdens on local resources (e.g., time of local staff), should be discussed with local partners
  
### **4. Honesty**
  - Clear roles, responsibilities, and expectations for conduct must be discussed across all parties involved in the research
  - Capacity-building for local researchers should be part of the project plan
  - Researchers must be clear and transparent in their communication: using plain, non-patronizing language, and without withholding any information
  - Researchers must not accept or support any form of corruption or bribery
  - Researchers must maintain high standards of data privacy even when local standards are lax


As you can see, the research community has done a lot to establish what we must expect from each other as researchers, wherever we are in the world. In the next section, we will take a closer look at how ethics is applied to different stages of the research process.

But before we proceed, let's check what you've learned so far with another quiz:
