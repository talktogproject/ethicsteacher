## Example: The TalkTogether approach

For example, here are the ways that research integrity is upheld by the TalkTogether team at different levels:

### **Within the research team**
* Training for ethics and study protocols are co-developed and conducted by members of the TalkTogether team (including this training course).
* We have regular meetings and milestones meetings within the research team.
* We create extensive written documentation of our study protocols and key decisions made by the research team, with an aim to produce tools and protocols for public use.

### **Within our organizations and academic institutions**
* We apply for ethics approval from each of the institutions involved. Currently, they are The Promise Foundation's ethics committee and the [University of Oxford's CUREC](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/ethics).
* Changes in the research protocol, if any, should be raised with the same ethics committees listed above.
* The University of Oxford provides [guidance on how to report research misconduct through multiple channels](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/integrity/misconduct#collapse390836).

### **With funding and governing agencies**
* We submit regular reports to our research funders for monitoring and evaluation. We have reported changes to the research programme as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Our funders ESRC & UKRI publish their own frameworks for [research integrity](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/supporting-healthy-research-and-innovation-culture/research-integrity/) and [research ethics](https://esrc.ukri.org/funding/guidance-for-applicants/research-ethics/).
* The UK Research Integrity Office has a [step-by-step manual for investigating allegations of research misconduct](http://ukrio.org/publications/misconduct-investigation-procedure/).

### **With the wider academic community**
* We engage and will continue to engage with academic peers and practitioners through conferences, working groups, roundtable discussions, and peer-reviewed publications.
* We invite external academics, practitioners, and stakeholders to review our protocols and outputs.
